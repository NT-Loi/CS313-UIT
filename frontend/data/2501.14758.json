    "abstract": "This study investigates how the new release of MacBook Pro I/O devices affects the obsolescence of related accessories. We also explore how these accessories will impact the environment and the economic consequences. As technology progresses, each new MacBook Pro releases outdated prior accessories, making more electronic waste. This phenomenon makes modern people need to change their traditional consumption patterns. We analyze changes in I/O ports and compatibility between MacBook Pro versions to determine which accessories are obsolete and estimate their environmental impact. Our research focuses on the sustainability of current accessories. We explore alternate methods of reusing, recycling, and disposing of these accessories in order to reduce waste and environmental impact. In addition, we will explore the economic consequences of rapid technological advances that make accessories obsolete too quickly. Thereby assessing the impact of such changes on consumers, manufacturers, and the technology industry. This study aims to respond to the rapid advancement of technology while promoting more sustainable approaches to waste management and product design. As the MacBook Pro I/O unit evolves, certain accessories become obsolete with each subsequent version. The purpose of this study is to identify and quantify the environmental and economic impacts of parts end-of-life. We can detect which accessories have become obsolete and assess the environmental impact by comparing I/O port changes and compatibility across MacBook Pro generations. In response to these environmental images, methods are developed to reuse, recycle, and dispose of obsolete accessories to reduce waste and promote sustainable development. Additionally, we evaluate the economic impact of obsolete equipment on consumers and producers.",
