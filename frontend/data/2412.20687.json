    "abstract": "The global shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) as a sustainable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars has triggered a significant rise in the demand for lithium-ion batteries. However, as the adoption of EVs grows, the issue of battery disposal and recycling has emerged as a critical challenge. The recycling of EV batteries is essential not only for reducing the environmental impact of battery waste but also for ensuring the sustainable supply of critical raw materials such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel. This paper explores recent innovations in the field of electric vehicle battery recycling, examining advanced techniques such as direct recycling, hydrometallurgical processes, and sustainable battery design. It also highlights the role of policy and industry collaboration in improving recycling infrastructure and addressing the economic and environmental challenges associated with battery waste. By focusing on both the technical and regulatory aspects of EV battery recycling, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state of the industry and the future outlook for recycling technologies, ultimately paving the way for a cleaner, more sustainable future in transportation.",
