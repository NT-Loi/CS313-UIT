    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital content, the task of summarizing multimedia documents, which encompass textual, visual, and auditory elements, presents intricate challenges. These challenges include extracting pertinent information from diverse formats, maintaining the structural integrity and semantic coherence of the original content, and generating concise yet informative summaries. This paper introduces a novel framework for multimedia document summarization that capitalizes on the inherent structure of the document to craft coherent and succinct summaries. Central to this framework is the incorporation of a rhetorical structure for structural analysis, augmented by a graph-based representation to facilitate the extraction of pivotal information. Weighting algorithms are employed to assign significance values to document units, thereby enabling effective ranking and selection of relevant content. Furthermore, the framework is designed to accommodate user preferences and time constraints, ensuring the production of personalized and contextually relevant summaries. The summarization process is elaborately delineated, encompassing document specification, graph construction, unit weighting, and summary extraction, supported by illustrative examples and algorithmic elucidation. This proposed framework represents a significant advancement in automatic summarization, with broad potential applications across multimedia document processing, promising transformative impacts in the field.",
