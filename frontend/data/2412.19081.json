    "abstract": "We have observed laser-induced fluorescence using 456 nm laser radiation, resonant with the 6S1/2-7P3/2 transition in Cs atoms. It includes red emission lines in the range of 580-730 nm and a prominent line at 852 nm corresponding to the 6P3/2-6S1/2 transition. A T-shaped all-sapphire cell with a length of 1 cm, containing Cs atomic vapor and capable of being heated up to 500 oC, was used. The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) power at 852 nm was investigated as a function of the cell temperature. The maximum LIF power was achieved at 130 oC, while a significant decrease was observed around 300 oC. At 130 oC, the Doppler-broadened LIF spectrum at 852 nm exhibited self-conversion, resulting in the formation of two distinct peaks within the spectrum. The LIF power at 852 nm was also studied as a function of the 456 nm radiation power. The Cs cell demonstrated potential as an efficient optical filter and down-converter, effectively transforming 456 nm radiation into 852 nm radiation.",
