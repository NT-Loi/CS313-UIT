    "abstract": "The integration of social media and artificial intelligence (AI) into disaster management, particularly for earthquake response, represents a profound evolution in emergency management practices. In the digital age, real-time information sharing has reached unprecedented levels, with social media platforms emerging as crucial communication channels during crises. This shift has transformed traditional, centralized emergency services into more decentralized, participatory models of disaster situational awareness. Our study includes an experimental analysis of 8,900 social media interactions, including 2,920 posts and 5,980 replies on X (formerly Twitter), following a magnitude 5.1 earthquake in Oklahoma on February 2, 2024. The analysis covers data from the immediate aftermath and extends over the following seven days, illustrating the critical role of digital platforms in modern disaster response. The results demonstrate that social media platforms can be effectively used as real-time situational awareness tools, delivering critical information to society and authorities during emergencies.",
