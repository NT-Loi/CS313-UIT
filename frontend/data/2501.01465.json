    "abstract": "Tracking surgical modifications based on endoscopic videos is technically feasible and of great clinical advantages; however, it still remains challenging. This report presents a modular pipeline to divide and conquer the clinical challenges in the process. The pipeline integrates frame selection, depth estimation, and 3D reconstruction components, allowing for flexibility and adaptability in incorporating new methods. Recent advancements, including the integration of Depth-Anything V2 and EndoDAC for depth estimation, as well as improvements in the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) alignment process, are detailed. Experiments conducted on the Hamlyn dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated methods. System capability and limitations are both discussed.",
