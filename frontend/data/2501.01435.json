    "abstract": "General Purpose AI - such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - have seen rapid deployment in a wide range of use cases. Most surprisingly, they have have made their way from plain language models, to chat-bots, all the way to an almost ``operating system''-like status that can control decisions and logic of an application. Tool-use, Microsoft co-pilot/office integration, and OpenAIs Altera are just a few examples of increased autonomy, data access, and execution capabilities. These methods come with a range of cybersecurity challenges. We highlight some of the work we have done in terms of evaluation as well as outline future opportunities and challenges.",
