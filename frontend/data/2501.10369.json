    "abstract": "This article evaluates how creative uses of machine learning can address three adjacent terms: ambiguity, uncertainty and indeterminacy. Through the progression of these concepts it reflects on increasing ambitions for machine learning as a creative partner, illustrated with research from Unit 21 at the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL. Through indeterminacy are potential future approaches to machine learning and design.",
