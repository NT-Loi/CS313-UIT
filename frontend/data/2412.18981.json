    "abstract": "Handwritten document recognition (HDR) is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computer vision, due to the various writing styles and complex layouts inherent in handwritten texts. Traditionally, this problem has been approached as two separate tasks, handwritten text recognition and layout analysis, and struggled to integrate the two processes effectively. This paper introduces HAND (Hierarchical Attention Network for Multi-Scale Document), a novel end-to-end and segmentation-free architecture for simultaneous text recognition and layout analysis tasks. Our model's key components include an advanced convolutional encoder integrating Gated Depth-wise Separable and Octave Convolutions for robust feature extraction, a Multi-Scale Adaptive Processing (MSAP) framework that dynamically adjusts to document complexity and a hierarchical attention decoder with memory-augmented and sparse attention mechanisms. These components enable our model to scale effectively from single-line to triple-column pages while maintaining computational efficiency. Additionally, HAND adopts curriculum learning across five complexity levels. To improve the recognition accuracy of complex ancient manuscripts, we fine-tune and integrate a Domain-Adaptive Pre-trained mT5 model for post-processing refinement. Extensive evaluations on the READ 2016 dataset demonstrate the superior performance of HAND, achieving up to 59.8% reduction in CER for line-level recognition and 31.2% for page-level recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model also maintains a compact size of 5.60M parameters while establishing new benchmarks in both text recognition and layout analysis.
