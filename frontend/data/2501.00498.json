    "abstract": "Gentzen-style sequent calculi and Gentzen-style natural deduction systems are introduced for a family (C-family) of connexive logics over Wansing's basic connexive logic C. The C-family is derived from C by incorporating the Peirce law, the law of excluded middle, and the generalized law of excluded middle. Theorems establishing equivalence between the proposed sequent calculi and natural deduction systems are demonstrated. Cut-elimination and normalization theorems are established for the proposed sequent calculi and natural deduction systems, respectively.",
