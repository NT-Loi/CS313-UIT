    "abstract": "In today's digital age, information systems (IS) are indispensable tools for organizations of all sizes. The quality of these systems, encompassing system, information, and service dimensions, significantly impacts organizational performance. This study investigates the intricate relationships between these three quality dimensions and their collective influence on key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. By conducting a comparative analysis of various quality metrics, we aim to identify the most effective indicators for assessing IS quality. Our research contributes to the field by providing actionable insights for researchers or practitioners to develop the implementation, evaluation and design of information systems. Also, a quantitative study employing a structured questionnaire survey was conducted to achieve primary data from respondents across various sectors. Statistical analysis, including Cronbach's Alpha (0.953) and factor analysis (KMO = 0.965, Bartlett's Test p < 0.000), revealed strong interdependencies among System Quality (SQ), Information Quality (IQ), and Service Quality (SerQ). The results demonstrate that high SQ leads to improved IQ, which in turn contributes to enhanced SerQ and user satisfaction. While all three qualities are crucial, SerQ emerges as the most relevant indicator of overall system performance due to its broader representation of quality dimensions",
