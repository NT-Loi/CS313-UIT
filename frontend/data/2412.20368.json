    "abstract": "Although robotic imitation learning (RIL) is promising for embodied intelligent robots, existing RIL approaches rely on computationally intensive multi-model trajectory predictions, resulting in slow execution and limited real-time responsiveness. Instead, human beings subconscious can constantly process and store vast amounts of information from their experiences, perceptions, and learning, allowing them to fulfill complex actions such as riding a bike, without consciously thinking about each. Inspired by this phenomenon in action neurology, we introduced subconscious robotic imitation learning (SRIL), wherein cognitive offloading was combined with historical action chunkings to reduce delays caused by model inferences, thereby accelerating task execution. This process was further enhanced by subconscious downsampling and pattern augmented learning policy wherein intent-rich information was addressed with quantized sampling techniques to improve manipulation efficiency. Experimental results demonstrated that execution speeds of the SRIL were 100\\% to 200\\% faster over SOTA policies for comprehensive dual-arm tasks, with consistently higher success rates.",
