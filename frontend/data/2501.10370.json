    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming mental health care by enhancing accessibility, personalization, and efficiency in therapeutic interventions. These AI-driven tools empower mental health professionals with real-time support, improved data integration, and the ability to encourage care-seeking behaviors, particularly in underserved communities. By harnessing LLMs, practitioners can deliver more empathetic, tailored, and effective support, addressing longstanding gaps in mental health service provision. However, their implementation comes with significant challenges and ethical concerns. Performance limitations, data privacy risks, biased outputs, and the potential for generating misleading information underscore the critical need for stringent ethical guidelines and robust evaluation mechanisms. The sensitive nature of mental health data further necessitates meticulous safeguards to protect patient rights and ensure equitable access to AI-driven care. Proponents argue that LLMs have the potential to democratize mental health resources, while critics warn of risks such as misuse and the diminishment of human connection in therapy. Achieving a balance between innovation and ethical responsibility is imperative. This paper examines the transformative potential of LLMs in mental health care, highlights the associated technical and ethical complexities, and advocates for a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach to ensure these advancements align with the goal of providing compassionate, equitable, and effective mental health support.",
