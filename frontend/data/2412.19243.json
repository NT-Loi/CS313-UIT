    "abstract": "Due to the vast address space of IPv6, the brute-force scanning methods originally applicable to IPv4 are no longer suitable for proactive scanning of IPv6. The recently proposed target generation algorithms have a low hit rate for existing IPv6 target generation algorithms, primarily because they do not accurately fit the distribution patterns of active IPv6 addresses. This paper introduces a diffusion model-based IPv6 target generation algorithm called 6Diffusion. 6Diffusion first maps addresses to vector space for language modeling, adds noise to active IPv6 addresses in the forward process, diffusing them throughout the entire IPv6 address space, and then performs a reverse process to gradually denoise and recover to active IPv6 addresses. We use the DDIM sampler to increase the speed of generating candidate sets. At the same time, we introduce the GLF-MSA (Global-Local Fusion Multi-Head Self-Attention) mechanism to adapt to the top-down global allocation pattern of IPv6 addresses and the local characteristics of IPv6 address segments, thus better learning the deep-level features of active IPv6 addresses. Experimental results show that compared to existing methods, 6Diffusion can generate higher quality candidate sets and outperforms state-of-the-art target generation algorithms across multiple metrics.",
