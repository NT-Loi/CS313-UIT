    "abstract": "This research paper presents the development of a lightweight and efficient computer vision pipeline aimed at assisting farmers in detecting orange diseases using minimal resources. The proposed system integrates advanced object detection, classification, and segmentation models, optimized for deployment on edge devices, ensuring functionality in resource-limited environments. The study evaluates the performance of various state-of-the-art models, focusing on their accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalization capabilities. Notable findings include the Vision Transformer achieving 96 accuracy in orange species classification and the lightweight YOLOv8-S model demonstrating exceptional object detection performance with minimal computational overhead. The research highlights the potential of modern deep learning architectures to address critical agricultural challenges, emphasizing the importance of model complexity versus practical utility. Future work will explore expanding datasets, model compression techniques, and federated learning to enhance the applicability of these systems in diverse agricultural contexts, ultimately contributing to more sustainable farming practices.",
