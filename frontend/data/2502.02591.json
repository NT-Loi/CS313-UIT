    "abstract": "The study of undersea cables and mooring lines statics remains an unavoidable subject of simulation in offshore field for either steady-state analysis or dynamic simulation initialization. Whether the study concerns mooring systems pinned both at seabed and floating platform, cables towed by a moving underwater system or when special links such as stiffeners are needed, the ability to model every combination is a key point. To do so the authors propose to investigate the use of the shooting method to solve the two point boundary value problem (TPBVP) associated with Dirichlet, Robin or mixed boundary conditions representing respectively, displacement, force and force/displacement boundary conditions. 3D nonlinear static string calculations are confronted to a semi-analytic formulation established from the catenary closed form equations. The comparisons are performed on various pairs of boundary conditions developed in five configurations.",
