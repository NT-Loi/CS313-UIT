    "abstract": "Cloud gaming requires a low-latency network connection, making it a prime candidate for being hosted at the network edge. However, an edge server is provisioned with a fixed compute capacity, causing an issue for multi-user service and resulting in users having to wait before they can play when the server is occupied. In this work, we present a new insight that when a user's network condition results in use of lossy compression, the end-to-end visual quality more degrades for frames of high rendering quality, wasting the server's computing resources. We leverage this observation to build Adrenaline, a new system which adaptively optimizes the game rendering qualities by considering the user-side visual quality and server-side rendering cost. The rendering quality optimization of Adrenaline is done via a scoring mechanism quantifying the effectiveness of server resource usage on the user-side gaming quality. Our open-sourced implementation of Adrenaline demonstrates easy integration with modern game engines. In our evaluations, Adrenaline achieves up to 24% higher service quality and 2x more users served with the same resource footprint compared to other baselines.",
