    "abstract": "Generative AIBIM, a successful structural design pipeline, has proven its ability to intelligently generate high-quality, diverse, and creative shear wall designs that are tailored to specific physical conditions. However, the current module of Generative AIBIM that generates designs, known as the physics-based conditional diffusion model (PCDM), necessitates 1000 iterations for each generation due to its reliance on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) sampling process. This leads to a time-consuming and computationally demanding generation process. To address this issue, this study introduces the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), an accelerated generation method that replaces the DDPM sampling process in PCDM. While the original DDIM was designed for DDPM and the optimization process of PCDM differs from that of DDPM, this paper designs \"DDIM sampling for PCDM,\" which modifies the original DDIM formulations to adapt to the optimization process of PCDM. Experimental results demonstrate that DDIM sampling for PCDM can accelerate the generation process of the original PCDM by a factor of 100 while maintaining the same visual quality in the generated results. This study effectively showcases the effectiveness of DDIM sampling for PCDM in expediting intelligent structural design. Furthermore, this paper reorganizes the contents of DDIM, focusing on the practical usage of DDIM. This change is particularly meaningful for researchers who may not possess a strong background in machine learning theory but are interested in utilizing the tool effectively.",
