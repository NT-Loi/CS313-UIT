    "abstract": "In this work, we propose an error-free, information-theoretically secure, asynchronous multi-valued validated Byzantine agreement (MVBA) protocol, called OciorMVBA. This protocol achieves MVBA consensus on a message $\\boldsymbol{w}$ with expected $O(n |\\boldsymbol{w}|\\log n + n^2 \\log q)$ communication bits, expected $O(n^2)$ messages, expected $O(\\log n)$ rounds, and expected $O(\\log n)$ common coins, under optimal resilience $n \\geq 3t + 1$ in an $n$-node network, where up to $t$ nodes may be dishonest. Here, $q$ denotes the alphabet size of the error correction code used in the protocol. When error correction codes with a constant alphabet size (e.g., Expander Codes) are used, $q$ becomes a constant. An MVBA protocol that guarantees all required properties without relying on any cryptographic assumptions, such as signatures or hashing, except for the common coin assumption, is said to be information-theoretically secure (IT secure). Under the common coin assumption, an MVBA protocol that guarantees all required properties in all executions is said to be error-free.\nWe also propose another error-free, IT-secure, asynchronous MVBA protocol, called OciorMVBArr. This protocol achieves MVBA consensus with expected $O(n |\\boldsymbol{w}| + n^2 \\log n)$ communication bits, expected $O(1)$ rounds, and expected $O(1)$ common coins, under a relaxed resilience (RR) of $n \\geq 5t + 1$. Additionally, we propose a hash-based asynchronous MVBA protocol, called OciorMVBAh. This protocol achieves MVBA consensus with expected $O(n |\\boldsymbol{w}| + n^3)$ bits, expected $O(1)$ rounds, and expected $O(1)$ common coins, under optimal resilience $n \\geq 3t + 1$.",
