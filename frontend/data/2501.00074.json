    "abstract": "As technology advances, the integration of physical, virtual, and social worlds has led to a complex landscape of ``Realities'' such as Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), metaverse, spatial computing, and other emerging paradigms. This paper builds upon and refines the concept of eXtended Reality (XR) as the unifying framework that not only interpolates across these diverse realities but also extrapolates (extends) to create entirely new possibilities. XR is the ``physical spatial metaverse,'' bridging the physical world, the virtual world of artificial intelligence, and the social world of human interaction. These three worlds define the Socio-Cyber-Physical Taxonomy of XR that allows us to identify underexplored research areas such as Diminished Reality (DR), and chart future directions to {\\bf advance technology for people and planet}. We highlight the six core properties of XR for applications in sustainability, healthcare, frontline work, and daily life. Central to this vision is the development of AI-driven wearable technologies, such as the smart eyeglass, that sustainably extend human capabilities.",
