    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in research presents both opportunities and ethical challenges that should be carefully navigated. Although GenAI tools can enhance research efficiency through automation of tasks such as literature review and data analysis, their use raises concerns about aspects such as data accuracy, privacy, bias, and research integrity. This paper develops the ETHICAL framework, which is a practical guide for responsible GenAI use in research. Employing a constructivist case study examining multiple GenAI tools in real research contexts, the framework consists of seven key principles: Examine policies and guidelines, Think about social impacts, Harness understanding of the technology, Indicate use, Critically engage with outputs, Access secure versions, and Look at user agreements. Applying these principles will enable researchers to uphold research integrity while leveraging GenAI benefits. The framework addresses a critical gap between awareness of ethical issues and practical action steps, providing researchers with concrete guidance for ethical GenAI integration. This work has implications for research practice, institutional policy development, and the broader academic community while adapting to an AI-enhanced research landscape. The ETHICAL framework can serve as a foundation for developing AI literacy in academic settings and promoting responsible innovation in research methodologies.",
