    "abstract": "In this paper, we tackle the parametric complete multiplicity problem for a univariate polynomial. Our approach to the parametric complete multiplicity problem has a significant difference from the classical method, which relies on repeated gcd computation. Instead, we introduce a novel technique that uses incremental gcds of the given polynomial and its high-order derivatives. This approach, formulated as non-nested subresultants, sidesteps the exponential expansion of polynomial degrees in the generated condition. We also uncover the hidden structure between the incremental gcds and pseudo-remainders. Our analysis reveals that the conditions produced by our new algorithm are simpler than those generated by the classical approach in most cases. Experiments show that our algorithm is faster than the one based on repeated gcd computation for problems with relatively big size.",
