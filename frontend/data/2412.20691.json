    "abstract": "Agent-based modeling (ABM) has become a cornerstone of complexity science, enabling the study of heterogeneous agents interacting within dynamic environments. Among ABM frameworks, John Conway's Game of Life (GoL) stands out for its simplicity and ability to generate emergent macroscopic patterns from basic microscopic rules. In this paper, we propose and implement a novel GoL-based framework to simulate urban migration dynamics. Using a grid-within-a-grid approach, our approach encodes probabilistic tendencies for out-migration due to densification and sparsification, simulating the evolution of population centers. By initializing GoL grids with different distributions and parameterizing migration preferences, we explore how urban structures emerge and stabilize over time. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that even with simple rules, this framework shows promise for understanding emergent urban phenomena, providing insights into city growth and structure. Methodologically, our framework offers a versatile and computationally efficient tool for studying urban migration patterns, contributing to the broader application of ABMs in computational urban social science.",
