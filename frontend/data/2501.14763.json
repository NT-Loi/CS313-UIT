    "abstract": "Job scheduling under various constraints to achieve global optimization is a well-studied problem. However, in scenarios that involve time-dependent constraints, such as scheduling backup jobs, achieving global optimization may not always be desirable. This paper presents a framework for scheduling new backup jobs in the presence of existing job schedules, focusing on satisfying intent-based constraints without disrupting current schedules. The proposed method accommodates various scheduling intents and constraints, and its effectiveness is validated through extensive testing against a variety of backup scenarios on real-world data from Veritas Netbackup customer policies.",
