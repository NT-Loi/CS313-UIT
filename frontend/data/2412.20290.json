    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely adopted for human activity recognition (HAR) while generalizing a trained model across diverse users and scenarios remains challenging due to distribution shifts. The inherent low-resource challenge in HAR, i.e., collecting and labeling adequate human-involved data can be prohibitively costly, further raising the difficulty of tackling DS. We propose TACO, a novel transformer-based contrastive meta-learning approach for generalizable HAR. TACO addresses DS by synthesizing virtual target domains in training with explicit consideration of model generalizability. Additionally, we extract expressive feature with the attention mechanism of Transformer and incorporate the supervised contrastive loss function within our meta-optimization to enhance representation learning. Our evaluation demonstrates that TACO achieves notably better performance across various low-resource DS scenarios.",
