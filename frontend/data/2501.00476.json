    "abstract": "This paper implies Bluetooth technology, which is put into effect to alter extant, wired into wireless Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). Here two Bluetooth devices are employed as a transceiver to transmit and receives the input signal to contrive wireless PLC. The main advantage of PLC is to control the output according to the status of input. In Bluetooth technology, the handshaking between the two Bluetooth modules takes place, which is interfaced with a microcontroller board (Arduino board) and then to PLC such that field devices can be controlled without wire.",
