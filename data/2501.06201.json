    "abstract": "How to properly fuse information from complex sources is still an open problem. Lots of methods have been put forward to provide a effective solution in fusing intricate information. Among them, Dempster-Shafer evidences theory (DSET) is one of the representatives, it is widely used to handle uncertain information. Based on DSET, a completely new method to fuse information from different sources based on pignistic transformation and Z-numbers is proposed in this paper which is able to handle separate situations of information and keeps high accuracy in producing rational and correct judgments on actual situations. Besides, in order to illustrate the superiority of the proposed method, some numerical examples and application are also provided to verify the validity and robustness of it.",
