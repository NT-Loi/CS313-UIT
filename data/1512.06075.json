    "abstract": "This paper considers the intra-image color-space of an object or a scene when these are subject to a dominant single-source of variation. The source of variation can be intrinsic or extrinsic (i.e., imaging conditions) to the object. We observe that the quantized colors for such objects typically lie on a planar subspace of RGB, and in some cases linear or polynomial curves on this plane are effective in capturing these color variations. We also observe that the inter-image color sub-spaces are robust as long as drastic illumination change is not involved.\nWe illustrate the use of this analysis for: discriminating between shading-change and reflectance-change for patches, and object detection, segmentation and recognition based on a single exemplar. We focus on images of food items to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",
