    "abstract": "Background: Brain network models offer insights into brain dynamics, but the utility of model-derived bifurcation parameters as biomarkers remains underexplored. Objective: This study evaluates bifurcation parameters from a whole-brain network model as biomarkers for distinguishing brain states associated with resting-state and task-based cognitive conditions. Methods: Synthetic BOLD signals were generated using a supercritical Hopf brain network model to train deep learning models for bifurcation parameter prediction. Inference was performed on Human Connectome Project data, including both resting-state and task-based conditions. Statistical analyses assessed the separability of brain states based on bifurcation parameter distributions. Results: Bifurcation parameter distributions differed significantly across task and resting-state conditions ($p < 0.0001$ for all but one comparison). Task-based brain states exhibited higher bifurcation values compared to rest. Conclusion: Bifurcation parameters effectively differentiate cognitive and resting states, warranting further investigation as biomarkers for brain state characterization and neurological disorder assessment.",
