    "abstract": "Fuzz testing effectively uncovers software vulnerabilities; however, it faces challenges with Autonomous Systems (AS) due to their vast search spaces and complex state spaces, which reflect the unpredictability and complexity of real-world environments. This paper presents a universal framework aimed at improving the efficiency of fuzz testing for AS. At its core is SaFliTe, a predictive component that evaluates whether a test case meets predefined safety criteria. By leveraging the large language model (LLM) with information about the test objective and the AS state, SaFliTe assesses the relevance of each test case. We evaluated SaFliTe by instantiating it with various LLMs, including GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-7B, and integrating it into four fuzz testing tools: PGFuzz, DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB. These tools are designed specifically for testing autonomous drone control systems, such as ArduPilot, PX4, and PX4-Avoidance. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to PGFuzz, SaFliTe increased the likelihood of selecting operations that triggered bug occurrences in each fuzzing iteration by an average of 93.1\\%. Additionally, after integrating SaFliTe, the ability of DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB to generate test cases that caused system violations increased by 234.5\\%, 33.3\\%, and 17.8\\%, respectively. The benchmark for this evaluation was sourced from a UAV Testing Competition.",
