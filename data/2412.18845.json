    "abstract": "Federated Graph Learning (FGL) has demonstrated the advantage of training a global Graph Neural Network (GNN) model across distributed clients using their local graph data. Unlike Euclidean data (\\eg, images), graph data is composed of nodes and edges, where the overall node-edge connections determine the topological structure, and individual nodes along with their neighbors capture local node features. However, existing studies tend to prioritize one aspect over the other, leading to an incomplete understanding of the data and the potential misidentification of key characteristics across varying graph scenarios. Additionally, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) nature of graph data makes the extraction of these two data characteristics even more challenging. To address the above issues, we propose a novel FGL framework, named FedGCF, which aims to simultaneously extract and fuse structural properties and node features to effectively handle diverse graph scenarios. FedGCF first clusters clients by structural similarity, performing model aggregation within each cluster to form the shared structural model. Next, FedGCF selects the clients with common node features and aggregates their models to generate a common node model. This model is then propagated to all clients, allowing common node features to be shared. By combining these two models with a proper ratio, FedGCF can achieve a comprehensive understanding of the graph data and deliver better performance, even under non-IID distributions. Experimental results show that FedGCF improves accuracy by 4.94%-7.24% under different data distributions and reduces communication cost by 64.18%-81.25% to reach the same accuracy compared to baselines.",
