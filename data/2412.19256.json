    "abstract": "Traditional smart contracts on blockchains excel at on-chain, deterministic logic. However, they have inherent limitations when dealing with large-scale off-chain data, dynamic multi-step workflows, and scenarios requiring high flexibility or iterative updates. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \"Swarm Contract\" (Swarm), a multi-agent mechanism wherein several digital life forms (DLF) or Sovereign Agents (SA) collectively handle complex tasks in Trusted Execution Environments (TEE). These digital entities are defined as autonomous software agents that own their code, state, and possibly on-chain assets, while operating free from centralized control.\nBy leveraging a simple multi-signature wallet on-chain, Swarm moves most of the logic off-chain, achieving trust minimization through multi-agent consensus rather than a single monolithic on-chain contract. We illustrate these ideas with a lightweight off-chain auction example - minting and selling 10,000 identical NFTs - to showcase how off-chain coordination can determine a clearing price and finalize distribution, with each step performed collectively by multiple agents in TEE. This approach broadens the scope of trustless and decentralized solutions, potentially benefiting DAO governance, multi-modal data processing, and cross-chain interoperability.",
