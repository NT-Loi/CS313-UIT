    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for developing a live vision-correcting display (VCD) to address refractive visual aberrations without the need for traditional vision correction devices like glasses or contact lenses, particularly in scenarios where wearing them may be inconvenient. We achieve this correction through deconvolution of the displayed image using a point spread function (PSF) associated with the viewer's eye. We address ringing artefacts using a masking technique applied to the prefiltered image. We also enhance the display's contrast and reduce color distortion by operating in the YUV/YCbCr color space, where deconvolution is performed solely on the luma (brightness) channel. Finally, we introduce a technique to calculate a real-time PSF that adapts based on the viewer's spherical coordinates relative to the screen. This ensures that the PSF remains accurate and undistorted even when the viewer observes the display from an angle relative to the screen normal, thereby providing consistent visual correction regardless of the viewing angle. The results of our display demonstrate significant improvements in visual clarity, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 83.04%, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",
