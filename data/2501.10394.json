    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel cryptographic approach based on the continuous logarithm in the complex circle, designed to address the challenges posed by quantum computing. By leveraging its multi-valued and spectral properties, this framework enables the reintroduction of classical algorithms (DH, ECDSA, ElGamal, EC) and elliptic curve variants into the post-quantum landscape. Transitioning from classical or elliptic algebraic structures to the geometric and spectral properties of the complex circle, we propose a robust and adaptable foundation for post-quantum cryptography.",
