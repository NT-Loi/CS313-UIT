    "abstract": "Credit Scoring is one of the problems banks and financial institutions have to solve on a daily basis. If the state-of-the-art research in Machine and Deep Learning for finance has reached interesting results about Credit Scoring models, usage of such models in a heavily regulated context such as the one in banks has never been done so far. Our work is thus a tentative to challenge the current regulatory status-quo and introduce new BASEL 2 and 3 compliant techniques, while still answering the Federal Reserve Bank and the European Central Bank requirements. With the help of Gradient Boosting Machines (mainly XGBoost) we challenge an actual model used by BANK A for scoring through the door Auto Loan applicants. We prove that the usage of such algorithms for Credit Scoring models drastically improves performance and default capture rate. Furthermore, we leverage the power of Shapley Values to prove that these relatively simple models are not as black-box as the current regulatory system thinks they are, and we attempt to explain the model outputs and Credit Scores within the BANK A Model Design and Validation framework",
