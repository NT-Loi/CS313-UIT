    "abstract": "User attribute prediction is a crucial task in various industries. However, sharing user data across different organizations faces challenges due to privacy concerns and legal requirements regarding personally identifiable information. Regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the Personal Information Protection Law of the People's Republic of China impose restrictions on data sharing. To address the need for utilizing features from multiple clients while adhering to legal requirements, federated learning algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms aim to predict user attributes without directly sharing the data. However, existing approaches typically rely on matching users across companies, which can result in dishonest partners discovering user lists or the inability to utilize all available features. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for predicting user attributes without requiring user matching. Our approach involves training deep matrix factorization models on different clients and sharing only the item vectors. This allows us to predict user attributes without sharing the user vectors themselves. The algorithm is evaluated using the publicly available MovieLens dataset and demonstrate that it achieves similar performance to the FedAvg algorithm, reaching 96% of a single model's accuracy. The proposed algorithm is particularly well-suited for improving customer targeting and enhancing the overall customer experience. This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of user attribute prediction by offering a novel algorithm that addresses some of the most pressing privacy concerns in this area.",
