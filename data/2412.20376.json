    "abstract": "Navigating dynamic and unstructured environments poses significant challenges for autonomous robots, particularly due to the uncertainty introduced by occluded areas. Conventional sensing methods often fail to detect obstacles hidden behind occlusions until they are dangerously close, especially in crowded spaces where human movement and physical barriers frequently obstruct the robot's view. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for occlusion-aware obstacle prediction using people as sensors, that infers the presence of para-occluded obstacles by analyzing human behavioral patterns. Our approach integrates sensor fusion, historical trajectory data, and predictive modeling to estimate the likelihood of obstacle presence and occupancy in occluded regions. By leveraging the natural tendency of humans to avoid certain areas, the system enables robots to proactively adapt their navigation strategies in real time. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances obstacle prediction accuracy, reduces collision risks, and improves navigation efficiency. These findings underscore the potential of occlusion-aware obstacle prediction systems to improve the safety and adaptability of autonomous robots in complex, dynamic environments.",
