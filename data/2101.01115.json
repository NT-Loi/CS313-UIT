    "abstract": "With the use of deep learning in many areas, how to improve this technology or how to develop the structure used more effectively and in a shorter time is an issue that is of interest to many people working in this field. Many studies are carried out on this subject, it is aimed to reduce the duration of the operation and the processing power required, except to obtain the best result with the changes made in the variables, functions and data in the models used. In this study, in the leaf classification made using Mendeley data set consisting of leaf images with a fixed background, all other variables such as layer number, iteration, number of layers in the model and pooling process were kept constant, except for the filter dimensions of the convolution layers in the determined model. Convolution layers in 3 different filter sizes and in addition to this, many results obtained in 2 different structures, increasing and decreasing, and 3 different image sizes were examined. In the literature, it is seen that different uses of pooling layers, changes due to increase or decrease in the number of layers, the difference in the size of the data used, and the results of many functions used with different parameters are evaluated. In the leaf classification of the determined data set with CNN, the change in the filter size of the convolution layer together with the change in different filter combinations and in different sized images was focused. Using the data set and data reproduction methods, it was aimed to make the differences in filter sizes and image sizes more distinct. Using the fixed number of iterations, model and data set, the effect of different filter sizes has been observed.",
