    "abstract": "Normalized relations extended with inherited attributes can be more faithful to reality and support logical navigation free queries, properties available at present only through specific views. Adding inherited attributes can be nonetheless always less procedural than to define any such views. Present schemes should even typically suffice for relations with foreign keys. Implementing extended relations on popular DBSs appears also simple. Relational model should evolve accordingly, for benefit of likely millions of DBAs, clients, developers.",
