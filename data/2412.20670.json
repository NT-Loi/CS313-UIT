    "abstract": "Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to transfer knowledge from a related, label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain, thereby circumventing the high costs associated with manual annotation. Recently, there has been growing interest in source-free domain adaptation, a paradigm in which only a pre-trained model, rather than the labeled source data, is provided to the target domain. Given the potential risk of source data leakage via model inversion attacks, this paper introduces a novel setting called black-box domain adaptation, where the source model is accessible only through an API that provides the predicted label along with the corresponding confidence value for each query. We develop a two-step framework named $\\textbf{Pro}$totypical $\\textbf{D}$istillation and $\\textbf{D}$ebiased tun$\\textbf{ing}$ ($\\textbf{ProDDing}$). In the first step, ProDDing leverages both the raw predictions from the source model and prototypes derived from the target domain as teachers to distill a customized target model. In the second step, ProDDing keeps fine-tuning the distilled model by penalizing logits that are biased toward certain classes. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ProDDing outperforms existing black-box domain adaptation methods. Moreover, in the case of hard-label black-box domain adaptation, where only predicted labels are available, ProDDing achieves significant improvements over these methods.
