    "abstract": "Processors may find some elementary operations to be faster than the others. Although an operation may be conceptually as simple as some other operation, the processing speeds of the two can vary. A clever programmer will always try to choose the faster instructions for the job. This paper presents an algorithm to display squares of 1st N natural numbers without using multiplication (* operator). Instead, the same work can be done using addition (+ operator). The results can also be used to compute the sum of those squares. If we compare the normal method of computing the squares of 1st N natural numbers with this method, we can conclude that the algorithm discussed in the paper is more optimized in terms of time complexity.",
