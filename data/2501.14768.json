    "abstract": "Equation discovery methods hold promise for extracting knowledge from physics-related data. However, existing approaches often require substantial prior information that significantly reduces the amount of knowledge extracted. In this paper, we enhance the EPDE algorithm -- an evolutionary optimization-based discovery framework. In contrast to methods like SINDy, which rely on pre-defined libraries of terms and linearities, our approach generates terms using fundamental building blocks such as elementary functions and individual differentials. Within evolutionary optimization, we may improve the computation of the fitness function as is done in gradient methods and enhance the optimization algorithm itself. By incorporating multi-objective optimization, we effectively explore the search space, yielding more robust equation extraction, even when dealing with complex experimental data. We validate our algorithm's noise resilience and overall performance by comparing its results with those from the state-of-the-art equation discovery framework SINDy.",
