    "abstract": "Looking at the last decade, progress in technology has made a huge impact on our lifestyles. Enhanced use of mobile phones has provided a technological breakthrough, with the latest smartphones capturing the market. The word smartphone is enough for everyone to understand the tremendous potential it brought to the market in terms of economics as well as usability. Not only this, this ever growing mobile mania has a lot more to offer. The familiarity of applications like dropbox etc is a clear indication of the popularity of mobile and cloud computing. But where we get all the benefits from this computing platform, there are some of the challenges too. However, with the enhanced facilities and luxuries, some challenges are always accompanied.",
