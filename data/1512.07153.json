    "abstract": "Data compression is very important feature in terms of saving the memory space. In this proposal, an indexed dictionary based compression is used for text data, where the word's reference in dictionary is used for compression. This approach is not file based, a common dictionary is used for compression. Which contains the words, the position of the word in dictionary is one of the key parts of encoded frame which is compressed form of the text word. This is loss-less compression. This compression approach is also take cares of small words like one or two characters words which usually decrease the efficiency of compression algorithms. This approach is also deals with file having special characters as a word. Special character words, alpha numeric words, normal texted words and small words all deals differently which makes this approach more efficient. Since a centralized dictionary is used for data compression, therefore, this approach is not preferred for transfer compressed file, while it is suitable to store text data in compressed form in hard disk drive and centralized storage or cloud drive for memory utilization.",
