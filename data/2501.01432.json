    "abstract": "Control systems are critical to modern technological infrastructure, spanning industries from aerospace to healthcare. This survey explores the landscape of safe robot learning, investigating methods that balance high-performance control with rigorous safety constraints. By examining classical control techniques, learning-based approaches, and embedded system design, the research seeks to understand how robotic systems can be developed to prevent hazardous states while maintaining optimal performance across complex operational environments.",
