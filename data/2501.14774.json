    "abstract": "Achieving carbon neutrality has become a critical goal in mitigating the environmental impacts of human activities, particularly in the face of global climate challenges. Input/Output (I/O) devices, such as keyboards, mice, displays, and printers, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions through their manufacturing, operation, and disposal processes. In this paper, we explores sustainable strategies for achieving carbon neutrality in I/O devices, emphasizing the importance of environmentally conscious design and development. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and best approaches, we introduces a framework to outline approaches for reducing the carbon footprint of I/O devices. The result underscore the necessity of integrating sustainability into the lifecycle of I/O devices to support global carbon neutrality goals and promote long-term environmental sustainability.",
