    "abstract": "This paper presents an advanced mapping system that combines drone imagery with machine learning and computer vision to overcome challenges in speed, accuracy, and adaptability across diverse terrains. By automating processes like feature detection, image matching, and stitching, the system produces seamless, high-resolution maps with minimal latency, offering strategic advantages in defense operations. Developed in Python, the system utilizes OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for efficient computations, and Concurrent[dot]futures for parallel execution. ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) is employed for feature detection, while FLANN (Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors) ensures accurate keypoint matching. Homography transformations align overlapping images, resulting in distortion-free maps in real time. This automation eliminates manual intervention, enabling live updates essential in rapidly changing environments. Designed for versatility, the system performs reliably under various lighting conditions and rugged terrains, making it highly suitable for aerospace and defense applications. Testing has shown notable improvements in processing speed and accuracy compared to conventional methods, enhancing situational awareness and informed decision-making. This scalable solution leverages cutting-edge technologies to provide actionable, reliable data for mission-critical operations.",
