    "abstract": "When simulating soft robots, both their morphology and their controllers play important roles in task performance. This paper introduces a new method to co-evolve these two components in the same process. We do that by using the hyperNEAT algorithm to generate two separate neural networks in one pass, one responsible for the design of the robot body structure and the other for the control of the robot.\nThe key difference between our method and most existing approaches is that it does not treat the development of the morphology and the controller as separate processes. Similar to nature, our method derives both the \"brain\" and the \"body\" of an agent from a single genome and develops them together. While our approach is more realistic and doesn't require an arbitrary separation of processes during evolution, it also makes the problem more complex because the search space for this single genome becomes larger and any mutation to the genome affects \"brain\" and the \"body\" at the same time.\nAdditionally, we present a new speciation function that takes into consideration both the genotypic distance, as is the standard for NEAT, and the similarity between robot bodies. By using this function, agents with very different bodies are more likely to be in different species, this allows robots with different morphologies to have more specialized controllers since they won't crossover with other robots that are too different from them.\nWe evaluate the presented methods on four tasks and observe that even if the search space was larger, having a single genome makes the evolution process converge faster when compared to having separated genomes for body and control. The agents in our population also show morphologies with a high degree of regularity and controllers capable of coordinating the voxels to produce the necessary movements.",
