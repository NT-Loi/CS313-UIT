    "abstract": "Fine-grained image classification, which is a challenging task in computer vision, requires precise differentiation among visually similar object categories. In this paper, we propose 1) a novel module called Residual Relationship Attention (RRA) that leverages the relationships between images within each training batch to effectively integrate visual feature vectors of batch images and 2) a novel technique called Relationship Position Encoding (RPE), which encodes the positions of relationships between original images in a batch and effectively preserves the relationship information between images within the batch. Additionally, we design a novel framework, namely Relationship Batch Integration (RBI), which utilizes RRA in conjunction with RPE, allowing the discernment of vital visual features that may remain elusive when examining a singular image representative of a particular class. Through extensive experiments, our proposed method demonstrates significant improvements in the accuracy of different fine-grained classifiers, with an average increase of $(+2.78\\%)$ and $(+3.83\\%)$ on the CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dog datasets, respectively, while achieving a state-of-the-art results $(95.79\\%)$ on the Stanford Dog dataset. Despite not achieving the same level of improvement as in fine-grained image classification, our method still demonstrates its prowess in leveraging general image classification by attaining a state-of-the-art result of $(93.71\\%)$ on the Tiny-Imagenet dataset. Furthermore, our method serves as a plug-in refinement module and can be easily integrated into different networks.",
