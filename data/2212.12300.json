    "abstract": "Every day, millions of credit cards are swiped and transactions are carried out across the world. Due to numerous forms of unethical digital activities, users are vulnerable to credit card fraud, phishing, identity theft, etc. This paper outlines a novel block encryption algorithm involving multiple private keys and a resilient trapdoor function that ensures data security while maintaining an optimal run time and space complexity. The proposed scheme consists of an irrepressible trapdoor based on a depressed cubic function and a unique key generation algorithm that uses Fibonacci sequences and invertible square matrices for improved security. The paper involves data obtained from comprehensive cryptanalysis exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of the system and comments on its potential large-scale industry applications.",
