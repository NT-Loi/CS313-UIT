    "abstract": "Etymologically, in Latin expresses \"educare\", that means to bring out, or be engaged in the infinite process of learning to present to the society as a valuable citizen. However, unfortunately especially in third world countries, education cannot be achieved due to, lack of inorganic and organic resources. However, many third world countries have embraced the concepts such as One Laptop per Child, facilitating the students to learn. The effective adaptation of these concepts has being launched through many government and non-government projects, providing inorganic resources. However, inorganic resources alone cannot provide quality education, as learning needs assessment procedures, feedback generators and trainers who could guide the students to gain knowledge. This paper attempts to introduce an acceptable solution that can be used to address facilitating resources to enhance the learning experience through enabling organic resources such as teachers, instructors and trainers on a remote mode through technology. This paper introduces a software system that is used to design and distribute examinations and detect gestures of students while answering remotely. The feature enables the teacher or instructor to gain a better understanding about the learner's attitude when taking the assessment. The content of the paper is organized to give the basic idea of the system and it includes description of the system and practical effectiveness of the system with evaluations from different views. A java enabled computer with a webcam and internet access is the minimum requirements to be able to use the proposed system. The development platform is based on java, with the use of \"Chilkat\" to maintain an asynchronous connection with the FTP server. \"iGesture\" and \"Yuille\" approach play major role in gesture detection and recognition.",
