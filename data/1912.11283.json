    "abstract": "The present work aims to enhance the application logs of an hypothetical infrastructure platform, and to build an App that displays the synthetic data about performance, anomalies and security incidents synthesized in the form of a Dashboard. The reference architecture, with multiple applications and multiple HW distribution, implementing a Service Oriented Architecture, is a real case of which the details have been abstracted because we want to extend the concept to all architectures with similar characteristics.",
