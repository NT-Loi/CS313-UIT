    "abstract": "This article examines the broader societal implications of blockchain technology and crypto-assets, emphasizing their role in the evolution of humanity as a \"superorganism\" with decentralized, self-regulating systems. Drawing on interdisciplinary concepts such as Nate Hagens' \"superorganism\" idea and Francis Heylighen's \"global brain\" theory, the paper contextualizes blockchain technology within the ongoing evolution of governance systems and global systems such as the financial system. Blockchain's decentralized nature, in conjunction with advancements like artificial intelligence and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), could transform traditional financial, economic, and governance structures by enabling the emergence of collective distributed decision-making and global coordination. In parallel, the article aligns blockchain's impact with developmental theories such as Spiral Dynamics. This framework is used to illustrate blockchain's potential to foster societal growth beyond hierarchical models, promoting a shift from centralized authority to collaborative and self-governed communities. The analysis provides a holistic view of blockchain as more than an economic tool, positioning it as a catalyst for the evolution of society into a mature, interconnected global planetary organism.",
