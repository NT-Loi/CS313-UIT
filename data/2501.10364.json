    "abstract": "Organizations increasingly need to reassess their supply chain strategies in the rapidly modernizing world towards sustainability. This is particularly true in the United States, where supply chains are very extensive and consume a large number of resources. This research paper discusses how AI can support decision-making for sustainable supply chains with a special focus on carbon footprints. These AI technologies, including machine learning, predictive analytics, and optimization algorithms, will enable companies to be more efficient, reduce emissions, and display regulatory and consumer demands for sustainability, among other aspects. The paper reviews challenges and opportunities regarding implementing AI-driven solutions to promote sustainable supply chain practices in the USA.",
