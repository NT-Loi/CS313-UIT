    "abstract": "In the landscape of TD algorithms, the Q($\\sigma$, $\\lambda$) algorithm is an algorithm with the ability to perform a multistep backup in an online manner while also successfully unifying the concepts of sampling with using the expectation across all actions for a state. $\\sigma \\in [0, 1]$ indicates the extent to which sampling is used. Selecting the value of {\\sigma} can be based on characteristics of the current state rather than having a constant value or being time based. This report explores the viability of such a TD-error based scheme.",
