    "abstract": "Sending emails in large quantities can be tedious considering free services do not cover bulk email and paid services can be costly and are not easy to customize. Traditional email client used for basic emailing services fail to be useful in larger volumes of emails to target people or spread information to consented individuals. This paper proposes a serverless architecture to tackle such problems by using one such offering from the Amazon Web Services(AWS) API which can be easily replaced by a software architects choice of service. The constraints help to make an architecture using components that can fit most of the needs of a serverless backend and extend it to scenarios such mobile notifications, One Time Password (OTP) systems or other means of communication to minimize single point of failure and also decrease the dependency on physical servers for such operations offering a comparable solution within the cloud. The architecture proposed is tested to find the time taken to send the emails of various quantities and see how it affects the cost. The architecture was successful able to send multiple emails in a quick and single invocation and has demonstrated a higher level of scalability compared to conventional methods.",
