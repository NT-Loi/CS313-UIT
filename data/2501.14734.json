    "abstract": "This study explores the integration of Agent AI with LangGraph to enhance real-time data analysis systems in big data environments. The proposed framework overcomes limitations of static workflows, inefficient stateful computations, and lack of human intervention by leveraging LangGraph's graph-based workflow construction and dynamic decision-making capabilities. LangGraph allows large language models (LLMs) to dynamically determine control flows, invoke tools, and assess the necessity of further actions, improving flexibility and efficiency.\nThe system architecture incorporates Apache Spark Streaming, Kafka, and LangGraph to create a high-performance sentiment analysis system. LangGraph's capabilities include precise state management, dynamic workflow construction, and robust memory checkpointing, enabling seamless multi-turn interactions and context retention. Human-in-the-loop mechanisms are integrated to refine sentiment analysis, particularly in ambiguous or high-stakes scenarios, ensuring greater reliability and contextual relevance.\nKey features such as real-time state streaming, debugging via LangGraph Studio, and efficient handling of large-scale data streams make this framework ideal for adaptive decision-making. Experimental results confirm the system's ability to classify inquiries, detect sentiment trends, and escalate complex issues for manual review, demonstrating a synergistic blend of LLM capabilities and human oversight.\nThis work presents a scalable, adaptable, and reliable solution for real-time sentiment analysis and decision-making, advancing the use of Agent AI and LangGraph in big data applications.",
