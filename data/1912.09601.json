    "abstract": "Every day the number of traffic cameras in cities rapidly increase and huge amount of video data are generated. Parallel processing infrastruture, such as Hadoop, and programming models, such as MapReduce, are being used to promptly process that amount of data. The common approach for video processing by using Hadoop MapReduce is to process an entire video on only one node, however, in order to avoid parallelization problems, such as load imbalance, we propose to process videos by splitting it into equal parts and processing each resulting chunk on a different node. We used some machine learning techniques to detect and track the vehicles. However, video division may produce inaccurate results. To solve this problem we proposed a heuristic algorithm to avoid process a vehicle in more than one chunk.",
