    "abstract": "Bilevel optimization, a hierarchical mathematical framework where one optimization problem is nested within another, has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex decision-making processes in various fields such as economics, engineering, and machine learning. This paper focuses on bilevel optimization where both upper-level and lower-level functions are black boxes and expensive to evaluate. We propose a Bayesian Optimization framework that models the upper and lower-level functions as Gaussian processes over the combined space of upper and lower-level decisions, allowing us to exploit knowledge transfer between different sub-problems. Additionally, we propose a novel acquisition function for this model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is highly sample-efficient and outperforms existing methods in finding high-quality solutions.",
