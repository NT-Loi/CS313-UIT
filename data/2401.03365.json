    "abstract": "Currently, the area of geometric modeling and the construction of 3D models based on point clouds from laser sensors is actively developing. One of the basic tasks of geometric modeling is the reconstruction of a surface from a cloud of points. The aim of this work is to develop a parallel least-squares surface reconstruction method on a distributed memory supercomputer that allows achieving optimal results both in scalability and surface reconstruction quality. The focus of the work is on the surface reconstruction algorithm based on the least squares method, in connection with which the algorithm was called the moving least squares method.",
