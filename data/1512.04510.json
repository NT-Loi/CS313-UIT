    "abstract": "Kolmogorov suggested to measure quality of a statistical hypothesis $P$ for a data $x$ by two parameters: Kolmogorov complexity $C(P)$ of the hypothesis and the probability $P(x)$ of $x$ with respect to $P$.\nP. Gács, J. Tromp, P.M.B. Vitányi discovered a small class of models that are universal in the following sense. Each hypothesis $S_{ij}$ from that class is identified by two integer parameters $i,j$ and for every data $x$ and for each complexity level $\\alpha$ there is a hypothesis $S_{ij}$ with $j\\le i\\le l(x)$ of complexity at most $\\alpha$ that has almost the best fit among all hypotheses of complexity at most $\\alpha$. The hypothesis $S_{ij}$ is identified by $i$ and the leading $i-j$ bits of the binary representation of the number of strings of complexity at most $i$. On the other hand, the initial data $x$ might be completely irrelevant to the the number of strings of complexity at most $i$. Thus $S_{ij}$ seems to have some information irrelevant to the data, which undermines Kolmogorov's approach: the best hypotheses should not have irrelevant information.\nTo restrict the class of hypotheses for a data $x$ to those that have only relevant information, Vereshchagin introduced a notion of a strong model for $x$: those are models for $x$ whose total conditional complexity conditional to $x$ is negligible. An object $x$ is called normal if for each complexity level $\\alpha$ at least one its best fitting model of that complexity is strong.\nIn this paper we show that there are \"many types\" of normal strings. Our second result states that there is a normal object $x$ such that all its best fitting models $S_{ij}$ are not strong for $x$. Our last result states that every best fit strong model for a normal object is again a normal object.",
