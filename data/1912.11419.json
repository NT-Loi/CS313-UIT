    "abstract": "IPv4 which is the old version of Internet Protocol has a new successor named IP Next Generation (IPng) or IPv6 developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This new version is developed specifically to resolve some issues of IPv4 like scalability, performance and reliability. Although new version is ready for usage, it is obvious that it will take years to transit fully from IPv4 to IPv6. We have to use these two versions together for a long time. Therefore, we have to investigate and know transition mechanisms that we can use during transition period to achieve a transition with minimum problem. This research defines the essential information about compatibility transition mechanisms between IPv4-IPv6. Dual Stack is one of the IPv4-IPv6 compatible mechanism by running both IPv4 stack and IPv6 stack in a single node. 6 to 4 tunneling mechanism encrypts IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets to make communications possible, from IPv6 network over IPv4 network. This has been configured using GNS3 Simulator and Packet Tracer 6.1. Dual Stack & Tunneling mechanisms were completely implemented later in this research work. This research examines transmission latency, throughput and delay from end to end, through empirical observations of both Dual Stack and tunneling mechanisms.",
