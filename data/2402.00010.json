    "abstract": "Social media has transformed the advertising landscape, becoming an essential tool for reaching and connecting with consumers. Its sharing and engagement features amplify brand exposure, while its cost-effective options provide businesses with flexible advertising solutions. TikTok is a more recent social media platform that has gained popularity for advertising, particularly in the realm of e-commerce, due to its large user base and viral nature. TikTok had 1.2 billion monthly active users in Q4 2021, generating an estimated $4.6 billion revenue in 2021. Virality can lead to a massive increase in brand exposure, reaching a vast audience that may not have been accessible through traditional marketing efforts alone. Advertisements for technological products are an example of such viral ads that are abundant on TikTok. The goal of this thesis is to understand how creators, community activity, and the recommendation algorithm influence the virality of advertisements for technology products on TikTok. The study analyzes various aspects of virality, including sentiment analysis, content characteristics, and the role of influencers. It employs data scraping and natural language processing tools to analyze metadata from 2,000 TikTok posts and 274,651, offering insights into the nuances of viral tech product advertising on TikTok.",
