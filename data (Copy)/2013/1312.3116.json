    "abstract": "The principles on which can be based computer model of process of training are formulated. Are considered: 1) the unicomponent model, which is recognizing that educational information consists of equal elements; 2) the multicomponent model, which is considering that knowledge is assimilate with a various strength, and on lesson weak knowledge becomes strong; 3) the generalized multicomponent model which considers change of working capacity of the pupil and various complexity of studied elements of a training material. Typical results of imitating modeling of learning process are presented in article.",
