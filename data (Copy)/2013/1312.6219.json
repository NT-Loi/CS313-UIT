    "abstract": "Biometrics authentication is an effective method for automatically recognizing individuals. The authentication consists of an enrollment phase and an identification or verification phase. In the stages of enrollment known (training) samples after the pre-processing stage are used for suitable feature extraction to generate the template database. In the verification stage, the test sample is similarly pre processed and subjected to feature extraction modules, and then it is matched with the training feature templates to decide whether it is a genuine or not. This paper presents use of a region of interest (ROI) for palm print technology. First some of the existing methods for palm print identification have been introduced. Then focus has been given on extraction of a suitable smaller region from the acquired palm print to improve the identification method accuracy. Several existing work in the topic of region extraction have been examined. Subsequently, a simple and original method has then proposed for locating the ROI that can be effectively used for palm print analysis. The ROI extracted using this new technique is suitable for different types of processing as it creates a rectangular or square area around the center of activity represented by the lines, wrinkles and ridges of the palm print. The effectiveness of the ROI approach has been tested by integrating it with a texture based identification / authentication system proposed earlier. The improvement has been shown by comparing the identification accuracy rate before and after the ROI pre-processing.",
