    "abstract": "Large-scale networked environments, such as the Internet, possess the characteristics of centralised data, centralised access and centralised control; this gives the user a powerful mechanism for building and integrating large repositories of centralised information from diverse resources set. However, a centralised network system with GSM Networks development for a hospital information systems or a health care information portal is still in its infancy. The shortcomings of the currently available tools have made the use of mobile devices more appealing. In mobile computing, the issues such as low bandwidth, high latency wireless Networks, loss or degradation of wireless connections, and network errors or failures need to be dealt with. Other issues to be addressed include system adaptability, reliability, robustness, extensibility, flexibility, and maintainability. GSM approach has emerged as the most viable approach for development of intelligent software applications for wireless mobile devices in a centralized environment, which gives higher band width of 900 MHz for transmission. The e-healthcare system that we have developed provides support for physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals, as well as for patients and medical devices used to monitor patients. In this paper, we present the architecture and the demonstration prototype.",
