    "abstract": "Data/Web Hosting is a service that lets enterprises or selves present their data on the internet that users can access. The firm providing such services are web/data host. Apart from that, such services require incessant support, and not everyone can afford a particular centralized data host service. The peer-to-peer(P2P) protocol, the Interplanetary file system(IPFS), is augmenting into a legitimate alternative to traditional data and web hosting. This paper put forward a decentralized blockchain IPFS-based interactive manageable model, and the work presents an application and schematic that serves as a Proof of Concept(PoC) of decentralized blockchain technology that can be wielded to create an immutable record of energy and resource usage for further analysis and estimation of yield at a scale. IPFS hosts an immutable record that would be independently verifiable and available in perpetuity. First, having the user connect to the service through an IPFS node, then requesting the user upload their data. Then the data is uploaded, and a CID(Content Identification) and a QR code are returned to the user, who can then compute and visualize the results through the application. This system enables the novel application of decentralized data storage to capture, add and visualize yield and environmental data and track it further down the supply chain.",
