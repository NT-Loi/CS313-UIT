    "abstract": "The 0/1 matrix factorization defines matrix products using logical AND and OR as product-sum operators, revealing the factors influencing various decision processes. Instances and their characteristics are arranged in rows and columns. Formulating matrix factorization as an energy minimization problem and exploring it with Simulated Annealing (SA) theoretically enables finding a minimum solution in sufficient time. However, searching for the optimal solution in practical time becomes problematic when the energy landscape has many plateaus with flat slopes. In this work, we propose a method to facilitate the solution process by applying a gradient to the energy landscape, using a rectified linear type cost function readily available in modern annealing machines. We also propose a method to quickly obtain a solution by updating the cost function's gradient during the search process. Numerical experiments were conducted, confirming the method's effectiveness with both noise-free artificial and real data.",
