    "abstract": "In this article, I will explore the nature of interference in translation, especially in technical and scientific texts, using a descriptivist approach. I will have a brief overview of the historical excursion of interference in technical and scientific translation. My aim is to explain this phenomenon and its causes with all its paradoxes, instead of simply condemning it as an example of supposedly bad translation. Thus, I will focus on its status in the bibliography of translation, on the motives for and consequences of interference in specialized translation, as well as on the nature of the arguments given for and against this phenomenon. Therefore the relationship between different societies has always been possible with the act of translation. When civilizations are examined throughout history, it is seen that the dissemination of knowledge among different societies has been achieved by translation. These societies have often become aware of the advancements in technology and science by means of translation. Therefore; translation becomes very significant in technical contact between societies and humans. Since the translation of technical texts is the preliminary scope of this thesis, it will be beneficial to have a brief look at the history of technical translation in the world.",
