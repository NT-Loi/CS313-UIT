    "abstract": "The paper is aimed at analyzing the potential of new information networks to solve the problems of energy management network with the use of renewable energy sources. One of the basic problems of renewable energy sources is their temporal and spatial variability. It is mainly about resources based on direct solar radiation and wind speed. New computer systems that use only classical connection-based solid structure of computer network connections but also on the basis of short-range connections allow accurate prediction of the active intensity changes observed energy. Using the system thus created can control precisely the basic energy equipment / generator and operable appliances / gradient to reduce the power needed resources or from work. This approach is one of the directions of further development of smart appliances and smart elements in the energy sector.",
