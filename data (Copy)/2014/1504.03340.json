    "abstract": "By developing communications and increase of access points, computer networks have been vulnerable considerably against wide range of information attacks, specially new and complicated attacks. Every day, replication attacks attack millions of network and mobile users. Increase in amount of replication attack may be a potential danger for income of SMS or network and causes losing customers of these services provider. Humans or software can be used to encounter these replication attacks. It is obvious that lonely absolute use of each method will not result in a proper answer to encounter replication attack`s problem. Since replication attack is one of the important problems of information protection and security in organizations for computer and mobile phone users, while reviewing types of replication attacks and methods of encountering, this paper uses similarities between pathologies in body and invader factors in replication attacks, a model is provided based on biological simulation methods existing in body`s adapted immune system to encounter these threats.",
