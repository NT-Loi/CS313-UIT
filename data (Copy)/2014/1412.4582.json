    "abstract": "Cloud computing is increasingly attracting large attention in computing both in academic research and in industrial initiatives. Emerging as a popular paradigm and an attractive model of providing computing, information technology (IT) infrastructure, network and storage to large and small enterprises both in private and public sectors. This project was initiated and aimed at designing and Setting up a basic Cloud lab Testbed running on Open stack under Virtual box for experiments and Hosting Cloud Platforms in the networking laboratory at the University of Bradford. This report presents the methodology of setting up a cloud lab testbed for experiment running on open stack. Current resources, in the Networking lab at the university were used and turned into virtual platforms for cloud computing testing. This report serves as a practical guideline, concentrating on the practical infrastructure related questions and issues, on setting up a cloud lab for testing and proof of concept. Finally the report proposes an experimental validation showing feasibility of migrating to cloud.\nThe primary focus of this report is to provide a brief background on different theoretical concepts of cloud computing, particularly virtualisation, and then it elaborates on the practical aspects concerning the setup and implementation of a Cloud lab test bed using open source solutions. This reports serves as a reference for institutions looking at the possibilities of implementing cloud solutions, in order to benefit from getting the basics and a view on the different aspects of cloud migration concepts.",
