    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is consisting of independent and distributed sensors to monitor physical or environmental conditions, such as temperature, sound, pressure, etc. However, the limited resources of sensors and hostile environments in which they could be deployed, make this type of networks vulnerable to several types of attacks similar to those occurring in ad hoc networks. The most crucial and fundamental challenge that WSN is facing is security. The primary subject of all my work is to address this issue. Due to minimum capacity in term of memory cost, processing and physical accessibility to sensors devices the security attacks are problematic. They are mostly deployed in open area so are more exposed to different kinds of attacks. They must be designed in a way to successfully recover itself from different kinds of attacks. In this paper, we proposed a new lightweight cryptography algorithm based on LEAP+. Our evaluations on TOSSIM give a precise and detailed idea of the extra cost of consumption of resources needed to ensure the high level of expected security.",
