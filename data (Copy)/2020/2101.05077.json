    "abstract": "In today's world, Neural Style Transfer (NST) has become a trendsetting term. NST combines two pictures, a content picture and a reference image in style (such as the work of a renowned painter) in a way that makes the output image look like an image of the material, but rendered with the form of a reference picture. However, there is no study using the artwork or painting of Bangladeshi painters. Bangladeshi painting has a long history of more than two thousand years and is still being practiced by Bangladeshi painters. This study generates NST stylized image on Bangladeshi paintings and analyzes the human point of view regarding the aesthetic preference of NST on Bangladeshi paintings. To assure our study's acceptance, we performed qualitative human evaluations on generated stylized images by 60 individual humans of different age and gender groups. We have explained how NST works for Bangladeshi paintings and assess NST algorithms, both qualitatively \\& quantitatively. Our study acts as a pre-requisite for the impact of NST stylized image using Bangladeshi paintings on mobile UI/GUI and material translation from the human perspective. We hope that this study will encourage new collaborations to create more NST related studies and expand the use of Bangladeshi artworks.",
