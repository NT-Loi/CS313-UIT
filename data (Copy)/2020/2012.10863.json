    "abstract": "With the incremental development of robotic platforms to automate the manual processes, path planning has become a critical domain with or without the knowledge of the indoor and outdoor environment. The algorithms can be intelligent or pre-structured and should optimally reach the destination efficiently. The major challenge in this domain is to find a path which is free from static obstacles as well as dynamic obstacles. In this paper, a methodology is proposed with the implementation details of the robotic platform to cover the critical key points and to arrive at the original key point in a dynamic environment. The main computation is happening inside a Raspberry Pi B+ module, and compass, wheel encoders and ultrasonic sensors were used in the implementation for the localization of the robot to relevant key points.",
