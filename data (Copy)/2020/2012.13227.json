    "abstract": "When an unmanned system is launched for a mission-critical task, it is required to follow a predetermined path. It means the unmanned system requires a path following algorithm for the completion of the mission. Since the predetermined path is typically given by a set of data-points, not only the curvature and derivative of the pre-determined path are absent, but also it requires a large size of on-board memory. In this work, we study a simple path following algorithm called Carrot-chasing algorithm that uses a simple controller in the form of a proportional controller to control the movement of an unmanned system.",
