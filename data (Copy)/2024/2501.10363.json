    "abstract": "DevOps can be best explained as people working together to conceive, build and deliver secure software at top speed. DevOps practices enable software development (dev) and operations (ops) teams to accelerate delivery through automation, collaboration, fast feedback, and iterative improvement. It is now an integral part of the information technology industry, and students should be aware of it before they start their careers. However, teaching DevOps in a university curriculum has many challenges as it involves many tools and technologies. This paper presents an innovative online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed to facilitate DevOps learning within university curricula. The devised tool offers a standardized, accessible learning environment, equipped with devcontainers and engaging tutorials to simplify learning DevOps. Research findings highlight a marked preference among students for self-paced learning approaches, with experienced DevOps practitioners also noting the value of the tool. With barriers such as limited hardware/software access becoming evident, the necessity for cloud-based learning solutions is further underscored. User feedback emphasizes the tool's user-friendliness and the imperative of automated installation procedures. We recommend additional exploration into the tool's extensibility and potential for continuous improvement, especially regarding the development of Dev Containers. The study concludes by emphasizing the pivotal role of practical learning tools in the dynamic field of DevOps education and research.",
