    "abstract": "This paper describes a memory-efficient transformer model designed to drive a reduction in memory usage and execution time by substantial orders of magnitude without impairing the model's performance near that of the original model. Recently, new architectures of transformers were presented, focused on parameter efficiency and computational optimization; however, such models usually require considerable resources in terms of hardware when deployed in real-world applications on edge devices. This approach addresses this concern by halving embedding size and applying targeted techniques such as parameter pruning and quantization to optimize the memory footprint with minimum sacrifices in terms of accuracy. Experimental results include a 52% reduction in memory usage and a 33% decrease in execution time, resulting in better efficiency than state-of-the-art models. This work compared our model with existing compelling architectures, such as MobileBERT and DistilBERT, and proved its feasibility in the domain of resource-friendly deep learning architectures, mainly for applications in real-time and in resource-constrained applications.",
