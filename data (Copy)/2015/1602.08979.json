    "abstract": "Career guidance for students, particularly in rural areas is a challenging issue in India. In the present era of digitalization, there is a need of an automated system that can analyze a student for his/her capabilities, suggest a career and provide related information. Keeping in mind the requirement, the present paper is an effort in this direction. In this paper, a fuzzy based conceptual framework has been suggested. It has two parts; in the first part a students will be analyzed for his/her capabilities and in the second part the available courses, job aspects related to their capabilities will be suggested. To analyze a student, marks in various subject in 10+2 standards and vocational interest in different fields have been considered and fuzzy sets have been formed. On example basis, fuzzy inference rules have been framed for analyzing the abilities in engineering, medical and hospitality fields only. In second part, concept of composition of relations has been used to suggest the related courses and jobs.",
