    "abstract": "Within the framework of the National Special Project for Magnetic Confined Nuclear Fusion Energy of China, the design of a superconducting magnet project as a test facility of the Nb3Sn coil or NbTi coil for the Chinese Fusion Engineering Test Reactor (CFETR) has been carried out not only to estimate the relevant conductor performance but also to implement a background magnetic field for CFETR CS insert and toroidal field (TF) insert coils. The superconducting magnet is composed of two parts: the inner part with Nb3Sn cable-in-conduit conductor (CICC) and the outer part with NbTi CICC. Both parts are connected in series and powered by a single DC power supply. The superconducting magnet can be cooled with supercritical helium at inlet temperature of 4.5 K. The total inductance and stored energy of the superconducting magnet are about 0.278 H and 436.6 MJ at an operating current of 56 kA respectively. An active quench protection circuit was adopted to transfer the stored magnetic energy of the superconducting magnet during a dump operation. In this paper, the design of the superconducting magnet and the main analysis results of the electromagnetic, structural and thermal-hydraulic performance are described.",
