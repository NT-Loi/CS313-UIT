ARCADE stands for Automated Reasoning: Challenges, Applications, Directions, Exemplary achievements. The goal of this workshop was to bring together key people from various sub-communities of automated reasoning--such as SAT/SMT, resolution, tableaux, theory-specific calculi (e.g. for description logic, arithmetic, set theory), interactive theorem proving---to discuss the present, past, and future of the field.",
