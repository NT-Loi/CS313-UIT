    "abstract": "This paper briefly reports our ongoing attempt at the development of a multi-platform browser-based speech recording system. We designed the system toward a service of providing open service of building large-scale speech corpora at a low-cost for any researchers and developers related to speech processing. The recent increase in the use of crowdsourcing services, e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, enable us to reduce the cost of collecting speakers in the web, and there have been many attempts to develop the automated speech collecting platforms or application that is designed for the use the crowdsourcing. However, one of the major problems in the previous studies and developments for the attempts is that most of the systems are not a form of common service of speech recording and corpus building, and each corpus builder is necessary to develop the system in their own environment including a web server. For this problem, we develope a new platform where both the corpus builders and recording participants can commonly use a single system and service by creating their user accounts. A brief introduction of the system is given in this paper as the start of this challenge.",
