    "abstract": "Defects in halide perovskites play an essential role in determining the efficiency and stability of the resulting optoelectronic devices. Here, we present a systematic study of intrinsic point defects in six primary metal halide perovskites, MAPbI$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, FAPbI$_3$, CsPbI$_3$ and MASnI$_3$, using density functional theory calculations with the SCAN+rVV10 functional. We analyse the impact of changing anions and cations on the defect formation energies and the charge state transitions levels and identify the physical origins underlying the observed trends. Dominant defects in the lead-iodide compounds are the A$^+$ cation interstitials (A = Cs, MA, FA), charge-compensated by I$^-$ interstitials or lead $({2-})$ vacancies. In the lead-bromide and -chloride compounds, halide vacancies become relatively more prominent, and for MAPbBr$_3$, the Pb$^{2+}$ interstitial also becomes important. The trends can be explained in terms of the changes in electrostatic interactions and chemical bonding upon replacing cations and anions. Defect physics in MASnI$_3$ is strongly dominated by tin $({2-})$ vacancies, promoted by the easy oxidation of the tin perovskite. Intrinsically, all compounds are mildly p-doped, except for MASnI$_3$, which is strongly p-doped. All acceptor levels created by defects in the six perovskites are shallow. Some defects, halide vacancies and Pb or Sn interstitials in particular, create deep donor traps. Although these traps might hamper the electronic behavior of MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbCl$_3$, in iodine-based perovskites their equilibrium concentrations are too small to affect the materials' properties.",
