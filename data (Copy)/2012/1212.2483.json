    "abstract": "The problem of finding a reduced dimensionality representation of categorical     variables while preserving their most relevant characteristics is fundamental     for the analysis of complex data. Specifically, given a co-occurrence matrix of     two variables, one often seeks a compact representation of one variable which     preserves information about the other variable. We have recently introduced     ``Sufficient Dimensionality Reduction' [GT-2003], a method that extracts     continuous reduced dimensional features whose measurements (i.e., expectation     values) capture maximal mutual information among the variables. However, such     measurements often capture information that is irrelevant for a given task.     Widely known examples are illumination conditions, which are irrelevant as     features for face recognition, writing style which is irrelevant as a feature     for content classification, and intonation which is irrelevant as a feature for     speech recognition. Such irrelevance cannot be deduced apriori, since it     depends on the details of the task, and is thus inherently ill defined in the     purely unsupervised case. Separating relevant from irrelevant features can be     achieved using additional side data that contains such irrelevant structures.     This approach was taken in [CT-2002], extending the information bottleneck     method, which uses clustering to compress the data. Here we use this     side-information framework to identify features whose measurements are     maximally informative for the original data set, but carry as little     information as possible on a side data set. In statistical terms this can be     understood as extracting statistics which are maximally sufficient for the     original dataset, while simultaneously maximally ancillary for the side     dataset. We formulate this tradeoff as a constrained optimization problem and     characterize its solutions. We then derive a gradient descent algorithm for     this problem, which is based on the Generalized Iterative Scaling method for     finding maximum entropy distributions. The method is demonstrated on synthetic     data, as well as on real face recognition datasets, and is shown to outperform     standard methods such as oriented PCA.",
