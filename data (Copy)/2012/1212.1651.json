    "abstract": "During years 2008 to 2011 author gives several courses on Foundations of Scientific Research at Computer Science Faculty of the National Aviation University in Kiev. This text presents material to lectures of the courses. It consists of 18 sections and some ideas of the manual can be seen from their titles. These include: General notions about scientific research. Ontologies and upper ontologies. Ontologies of object domains. Examples of Research Activity. Some Notions of the Theory of Finite and Discrete Sets. Algebraic Operations and Algebraic Structures. Elements of the Theory of Graphs and Nets. Scientific activity on the example of Information and its investigation. Scientific research in Artificial Intelligence. Compilers and compilation. Objective, Concepts and History of Computer security. Methodological and categorical apparatus of scientific research. Methodology and methods of scientific research. Scientific idea and significance of scientific research. Forms of scientific knowledge organization and principles of scientific research. Theoretical study, applied study and creativity. Types of scientific research: theoretical study, applied study. Types of scientific research: forms of representation of material. Some sections of the text contain enough material to lectures, but in some cases these are sketchs without references to Foundations of Research Activities. Really this is the first version of the manual and author plans to edit, modify and extend the version. Some reasons impose the author to post it as e-print. . Author compiled material from many sources and hope that it gives various points of view on Foundations of Research Activities.",
