    "abstract": "In the field of Artificial intelligence Image processing plays a vital role in Decision making. Nowadays Mobile robots work as a Network sharing Centralized Database. All Image inputs are compared against this database and decision is made. In some cases the Centralized database is in other side of the globe and Mobile robots compare Input image through satellite link this sometime results in delays in decision making which may result in castrophe. This Research paper is about how to make image processing in mobile robots less time consuming and fast decision making. This research paper compares search techniques employed currently and optimum search method which we are going to state. Nowadays Mobile robots are extensively used in environments which are dangerous to human beings. In this dangerous situations quick Decision making makes the difference between Hit and Miss this can also results in Day to day tasks performed by Mobile robots Successful or Failure.",
