    "abstract": "Operating Systems exists since existence of computers, and have been evolving continuously from time to time. In this paper we have reviewed a relatively new or unexplored topic of Live OS. From networking perspective, Live OS is used for establishing Clusters, Firewalls and as Network security assessment tool etc. Our proposed concept is that a Live OS can be established or configured for an organizations specific network requirements with respect to their servers. An important server failure due to hardware or software could take time for remedy of the problem, so for that situation a preconfigured server in the form of Live OS on CD/DVD/USB can be used as an immediate solution. In a network of ten nodes, we stopped the server machine and with necessary adjustments, Live OS replaced the server in less than five minutes. Live OS in a network environment is a quick replacement of the services that are failed due to server failure (hardware or software). It is a cost effective solution for low budget networks. The life of Live OS starts when we boot it from CD/DVD/USB and remains in action for that session. As soon as the machine is rebooted, any work done for that session is gone, (in case we do not store any information on permanent storage media). Live CD/DVD/USB is normally used on systems where we do not have Operating Systems installed. A Live OS can also be used on systems where we already have an installed OS. On the basis of functionality a Live OS can be used for many purposes and has some typical advantages that are not available on other operating systems. Vendors are releasing different distributions of Live OS and is becoming their sole identity in a particular domain like Networks, Security, Education or Entertainment etc. There can be many aspects of Live OS, but Linux based Live OS and their use in the field of networks is the main focus of this paper.",
