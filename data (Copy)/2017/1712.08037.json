    "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to explore the potential impact of the use of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) to form traditional cold-formed steel structural members. In this study, shell finite element models are constructed, and geometric and material nonlinear collapse analysis performed, on simulated lipped channel cross-section cold-formed steel members roll-formed from AHSS. AHSS sheet is currently being used in automotive applications with thickness ranging from 0.35 to 0.8 mm (0.0138 to 0.0315 in.) and yield strengths from 350 to 1250 MPa (51 to 181 ksi). However, AHSS has not yet been employed in cold-formed steel construction. To assess the impact of the adoption of AHSS on cold-formed steel member strength a group of forty standard structural lipped channel cross-sections are chosen from the Steel Framing Industry Association product list and simulated with AHSS material properties. The stress-strain models used in this study are based on AHSS in production, including dual-phase and martensitic steels. The simulations consider compression with work on bending about the major axis in progress. Three different bracing conditions are employed so that the impact of local, distortional, and global buckling, including interactions can be explored. Due to the higher yield stresses of AHSS the potential for interaction and mode switching is anticipated to be greater in these members compared with conventional mild steels. The simulations provide a direct means to assess the increase in strength created by the application of AHSS, while also allowing for future exploration of the increase in buckling mode interaction, imperfection sensitivity, and strain demands inherent in the larger capacities. The work is intended to be an initial step in a longer-term effort to foster innovation in the application of new steels in cold-formed steel construction.",
