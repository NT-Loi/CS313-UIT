    "abstract": "A programming language is a formally constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms. Most programs that are written by programmers are often compiled correctly with no syntax or semantic errors. However, some other errors appear after the execution of the program (logical error). Logical Errors (LE) are errors that remain after all syntax errors have been removed. Usually, the compiler does not detect LE, so the produced results are different from what the programmer is expecting. For this reason, discovering and fixing the logical error is very hard and proposes a good topic for research and practice. Some LE are resulted from the misuse of classes' objects, and in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), it is considered that the software with LE is low-quality software with high maintenance cost. In this paper, an object-oriented environment that allows the programmer to detect and discover LE to avoid it. This environment will be called Object Behavior Environment (OBEnvironment) will enforce the correct use of objects according to their predefined behaviors by using tools like Xceed Component (that appeal .Net windows form developers for building better applications), Alsing Component (that provides an area to programmer that allows writing correct syntax code by C# language) and, Mind Fusion Component (that provides an area to programmer that allows drawing State Diagrams to show object state).",
