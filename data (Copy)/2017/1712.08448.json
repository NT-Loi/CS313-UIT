    "abstract": "The scripting language described in this document is (in the first place) intended to be used on robots developed by Anja Mølle Lindelof and Henning Christiansen as part of a research project about robots performing on stage.\nThe target robots are expected to appear as familiar domestic objects that take their own life, so to speak, and perhaps perform together with human players, creating at illusion of a communication between them. In the current version, these robots' common behaviour is determined uniquely by a script written in the language described here -- the only possible autonomy for the robots is action to correct dynamically for inaccuracies that arise during a performance.\nThe present work is preliminary and has not been compared to properly to other research work in this area, and the testing is still limited. A first implementation on small Lego Mindstorms based robots is under development by Mads Saustrup Fox as part of his master thesis work.",
